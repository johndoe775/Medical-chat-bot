# Medical-chat-bot
This project is a sophisticated application that utilizes a medical handbook to develop a RAG agent using Flask, a popular web framework for Python, and Pinecone, a powerful database solution. 
Project Structure
The project consists of several key components:

  app.py: This is the main Flask application file that sets up the server, defines the endpoints, and handles the logic for the RAG agent.
  Data: This folder contains the medical handbook data, which is used by the RAG agent to make its assessments.
  requirements.txt: This file lists all the necessary dependencies for the project, ensuring that you can easily set up the project in your own environment.
